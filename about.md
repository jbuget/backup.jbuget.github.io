Hi! It's Jérémy. I'm a [full-stack developer](https://github.com/jbuget) since 2007.

I'm french – nobody is perfect. I live close to Paris with my wife, our two children and our old english bulldog.

I love making innovative Web sites for the general public, such as the [booking site](https://www.clubmed.fr) of Club Med, the <a href="http://www.ingdirect.fr/credit-immobilier/#simulateurCI">home loan simulator</a> for ING Direct or the new [online ticketing service](https://tickets.rolandgarros.com) of Roland-Garros.

I've worked for 4 years for [OCTO Technology](http://www.octo.com/fr), as a software architect and developer. Since 2016, I'm the leader of the WEBF tribe, dedicated to the Web front-end development.

Since one year I've worked as CTO on a french [Governmental Start-up](https://pix.beta.gouv.fr) named <a href="https://pix.beta.gouv.fr">Pix</a>, which is an online and free assessment platform about digital competences for french people.

My main technologies are HTM, JavaScript and CSS. I used Java and JVM technologies for more than 8 years but this time is far away now.

After making the right thing at the right time, the thing I prefer is making the thing right. I try to make my [code clean](http://ricardogeek.com/docs/clean_code.pdf) and I'm aware of [DDD](http://ptgmedia.pearsoncmg.com/images/9780321834577/samplepages/0321834577.pdf), [clean architecture](https://8thlight.com/blog/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html) and all other [software craftsmanhip practices](http://manifesto.softwarecraftsmanship.org) or [agile methodologies](http://agilemanifesto.org).

Today, the most important thing to me when I code is "knowing, using and respecting the standards". It's why I (will always) prefer Vue.js over React, or Ember.js over Angular.

My main purpose when I wake up every morning is _"help people growing and having fun"_.
